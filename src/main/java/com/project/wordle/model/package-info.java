/**
 * This package contains the model classes that represent the data entities used in the application.
 * Each model class corresponds to a table in the database or a document in a PostgreSQL database.
 * Models define the structure and behavior of the data they represent, including any relationships to other models.
 * The classes in this package should follow the naming convention of using singular nouns, e.g. "User".
 * They should also be annotated with the appropriate JPA annotations such as @Entity, @Table, @Column as necessary.
