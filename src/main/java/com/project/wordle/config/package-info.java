/**
 * This package contains the classes responsible for handling and managing the configuration settings of the system or device.
 * The configuration package should follow a consistent naming convention, such as suffixing each class name with "Config".
 * Each class within the package should contain the necessary methods and attributes to manage the configuration settings,
 * such as getters and setters for individual configuration values or methods to save and load configuration files.
 * Depending on the specific needs of the system or device, the configuration classes may interact with other components,
 * such as services, repositories, or models, to perform their tasks. They should also be designed to ensure the integrity and security
 * of the configuration data, and provide appropriate error handling and feedback to users.
 * The package should be organised and structured in a logical and intuitive manner, with classes grouped together based on their
 * functionality and relationship to one another. The classes should also be properly documented with clear and concise descriptions
 * of their purpose, methods, and attributes, using appropriate JavaDoc conventions and annotations.
